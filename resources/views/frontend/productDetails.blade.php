                                            <p>Polyester is deemed lower quality due to its none natural quality’s. Made
                                                from synthetic materials, not natural like wool. Polyester suits become
                                                creased easily and are known for not being breathable. Polyester suits
                                                tend to have a shine to them compared to wool and cotton suits, this can
                                                make the suit look cheap. The texture of velvet is luxurious and
                                                breathable. Velvet is a great choice for dinner party jacket and can be
                                            worn all year round.</p>
